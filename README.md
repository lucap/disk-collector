See [live demo](https://lucap.github.io/disk-collector/)

## Notes

* Mobile First design and implemenation
* Uses virtual scroll to view all records

## Known Issues (next steps)

* Initial loading UX: should show progress at least. Could start rendering records incrementally
* UX around adding records to shelves needs improvements, currently only drag and drop from a nearby shelf is suported
